Hi.

I'm Faruq Rasid — my actual name is pretty long though. This blog is going to showcase my reflections on life, travels and tech.

Just a bit about myself, I started learning programming on my own when I was 11 years old. Like many others, my first *language* was HTML (yeah, not really a language, I know). Back then, sites were coded with HTML tables, has flashy GIFs (*jeef*) and midi files playing when the site is loaded — totally a different era.

Anyway! Progressively, I moved to JS, PHP, C/C++ and tried dozen of other languages. I actually tried C++ first before PHP but couldn't grasp it (*WTH are pointers!?*) so I dropped it first and picked up PHP. Back then frameworks wasn't a thing yet too. Everything is done from scratch!

Fast forward to today, I mostly work **Android (Java)**, **Golang**, **PHP**, **NodeJS**, **React (Typescript)**. In my opinion, getting started with software programming these days is *10 times easier* than when I started. And most interestingly, previously it is a *geeky* profession but a *hot/cool thing* to dabble with these days. Amazing how times have changed in just a decade.

I'm looking forward to try to pick up Rust next (just for fun). Let's hope I can find time for that and to blog about my journey with it too!
